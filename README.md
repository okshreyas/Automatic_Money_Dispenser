**#Project Title: Automatic Money Dispenser Software**

Description:
The Automatic Money Dispenser Software is a Java-based application that leverages advanced programming techniques to facilitate seamless and secure financial transactions. The software incorporates a range of robust functionalities, including user authentication, fund transfers, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and statement generation. The application harnesses the power of Swing and AWT libraries to create an interactive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) that ensures a smooth user experience. Additionally, it establishes a connection with a Microsoft Access database using the UCanAccess database driver, thereby ensuring efficient and reliable data management.

Key Features:

Login: The software employs a sophisticated login mechanism that utilizes secure encryption algorithms to authenticate user credentials, safeguarding against unauthorized access.

Transfer Money: Users can initiate fund transfers seamlessly within their own accounts or to other registered accounts. The application incorporates rigorous validation mechanisms to verify transaction details and updates account balances accurately and securely.

Withdraw Money: The software enables users to withdraw cash from their accounts by specifying the desired amount. By conducting comprehensive checks on fund availability, the application ensures reliable and error-free cash withdrawal while simultaneously updating the account balance.

Pay Bills: Users can conveniently settle bills for various services, such as utilities, telecommunications, or credit cards, using the application. Robust validation protocols ensure accurate bill processing, deduction of the corresponding amount from the user's account, and secure transaction completion.

Get Statement: The software offers users the ability to generate detailed and comprehensive account statements, providing a comprehensive overview of their financial activities. These statements include transaction details, current balances, and other pertinent information, empowering users with an insightful financial overview.

Technology Stack:

Java: The project is developed using the Java programming language, renowned for its versatility, portability, and extensive library support.
Swing and AWT: The application leverages the power of Swing and AWT libraries, widely recognized for creating feature-rich and visually appealing GUIs.
UCanAccess: The software integrates the UCanAccess database driver to establish a robust connection between the Java application and the Microsoft Access database, ensuring seamless data retrieval and management.
MS Access: The project utilizes Microsoft Access, a reliable and widely adopted database management system, to store and manage user account information and transaction records.
